\description{
Ume√• University provides a web \href{https://klassificera.ub.umu.se/}{api} described
\href{https://klassificera.ub.umu.se/api2.html}{here}, for classifying
english and swedish language records from DiVA or Swepub based on the MODS
format (v 3.2 or later) according to the \href{https://www.scb.se/dokumentation/klassifikationer-och-standarder/standard-for-svensk-indelning-av-forskningsamnen/}{Swedish standard}.
Classification can also be made based on a \href{https://klassificera.ub.umu.se/uploadFile.txt}{Web of Science record}
Uploaded record batches may not exceed 200 MB, using batches of 10 MB are
recommended (around 2-3000 records per chunk)
}
\details{
The classification is based on information in there record from the title
and abstract (required) but also on keywords, ISSN/journal, ISBN-prefix/
publisher and affiliations. Training data comes from SwePub (July 2020).
It is based on the following papers:
\itemize{
\item Dual Coordinate Descent Methods for Logistic Regression and Maximum
Entropy Models. (\href{https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-010-5221-8}{doi:10.1007/s10994-010-5221-8})
\item Entropy-Based Term Weighting Schemes for Text Categorization in VSM. (\href{https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2015.57}{doi:10.1109/ICTAI.2015.57})
}

The classification is made at the research topic level (5 digits)
for English language records and at research subject group level
3 digits for Swedish language records.

\examples{
\dontrun{

# classify using a DiVA record identifier
classify_umu_ub("diva2:515038", threshold = 0.3, email = "john.doe@hotmail.com")

# classify using a WoS Record in Flatfile/Plain text format
wos_record <- readr::read_lines("https://klassificera.ub.umu.se/uploadFile.txt")
classify_umu_ub(wos_record, type = "wos")
}
